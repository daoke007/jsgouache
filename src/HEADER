 About:

    JsGouache aims to offer a tool for javascript developers to manipulate colors
    within various color spaces while attempting to raise awareness for different 
    types of color deficiencies.
    
    The library offers various functions for manipulation of the more common color
    spaces used on the web: RGB, Hexadecimal, HSL. It also implements a theoretical 
    (limited) simulation of the LMS color space (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LMS_Color_Space) 
    
 Development:
 
    JsGouache uses the NewJs Gem from Dr.Nic as it's build system, which means that 
    in order to contribute to the development of this library you need to have ruby 
    and a couple gems installed. All the sources files are found in the /src folder
    and compiled into a single javascript file using a rake task. If you download
    the source code and dont know how all this ruby and rake stuff works, all you 
    need is probably in the /dist folder (and maybe /docs for the html documentation).
