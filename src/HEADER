 About:

    JsGouache aims to offer a tool for javascript developers to manipulate colors
    within various color spaces while attempting to raise awareness for different 
    types of color deficiencies.
    
    The library offers various functions for manipulation of the more common color
    spaces used on the web: RGB, Hexadecimal, HSL. It also implements a theoretical 
    (limited) simulation of the LMS color space (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LMS_Color_Space)

    Mike Koss has a pretty interesting approach at 'class' inheritance 
    that he explains here: http://mckoss.com/jscript/object.htm
